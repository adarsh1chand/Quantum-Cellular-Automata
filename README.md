# Quantum-Cellular-Automata
Extending Conway's Game of Life to quantum domain. <br>

**Background**


The rules of the evolution are based on custom defined Hamiltonian, which is based on the moore neighbourhood of a cell, but can easily be extended to All the code is in a single python notebook.
**Controls**:
- <code>W</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>D</code> to move to up, left, right, down.
- <code>BACKSPACE</code> to reset the grid to last configuration.
- <code>SPACE</code> to start the evolution of the grid.
- <code>ESC</code> to quit the simulation.
